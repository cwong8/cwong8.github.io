      <p>This part of the project is currently on hold. As it turns out, optimizing paths on a graph with many variables is very difficult. I have tried two different methods so far: recursive ant colony optimization and using Python’s igraph library to find and calculate “reasonable” paths. Calculating paths between 300+ nodes on a weighted graph has a high time complexity which seems to make the last method unfeasible.</p>

<p>I plan on learning machine learning to see if those methods will assist in finishing this project.</p>

<h2 id="recursive-ant-colony-optimization">Recursive ant colony optimization</h2>

<p>This was my first attempt at optimizing, using a modified version of the ant colony optimization algorithm from <a href="https://github.com/Akavall/AntColonyOptimization">Akavall’s Github</a>. My Python script can be downloaded here: <a href="/projects/BDO_Optimization/optimization/ant_colony_modified.py">ant_colony_modified.py</a></p>

<h2 id="igraph">igraph</h2>

<p>Second attempt used igraph before I ran into a problem of time complexity. <a href="/projects/BDO_Optimization/optimization/igraph_optimization/">igraph_optimization.md</a></p>
