# Introduction

Online retail and shopping has been an emerging and booming industry in the past decade. For example, everybody knows about Amazon.com and how it is the largest online retailer in the world, constantly expanding its services and products. The convenience of online shopping is attractive to consumers and as such they are continually trending towards it. In our project, we analyze data from a UK-based non-store online retailer which sells unique all-occasion gifts to mainly wholesalers. 

```{r, warning = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/Christopher Wong/Desktop/Projects/STA 141A/Project")
library(data.table)

online.retail <- as.data.frame(fread("Online Retail.csv"))
attach(online.retail)
```

# Material and Methods

The data can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail

Attribute Information:
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  \textbf{InvoiceNo:} & Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction.\\
  & If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.\\
  \textbf{StockCode:} & Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.\\
  \textbf{Description:} & Product (item) name. Nominal.\\
  \textbf{Quantity:} & The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.\\
  \textbf{InvoiceDate:} & Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.\\
  \textbf{UnitPrice:} & Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.\\
  \textbf{CustomerID:} & Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.\\
  \textbf{Country:} & Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.\\
\end{tabular}

The data consists of 541,909 observations of these variables. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between December 1, 2010 and December 9, 2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

To analyze the data, we used the packages \textbf{ggmap} to visualize the countries and plot them on a world map, \textbf{ggplot2} and base plotting functions to visualize the data, \textbf{stringr} and base string manipulation functions (such as strsplit) to work with the invoice dates, and \textbf{dplyr} and \textbf{plyr} to make manipulating the data easier.

# Plotting all of this information
item.seasons <- lapply(1:length(items.seasons), function(i){
  d <- sapply(quantities.sold.seasons, '[[', i)
  return(d)
})
names(item.seasons) <- items.seasons

d.seasons <- data.frame(item.seasons)
```

To answer this question, we began by finding the start and end dates of seasons for the years 2010 and 2011. The relevant dates and seasons are:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
  \hline
  Year & Spring & Summer & Fall & Winter\\
  \hline
  2010 & (NA) & (NA) & September 23, 2010 & December 21, 2010\\
  \hline
  2011 & March 20, 2011 & June 21, 2011 & September 23, 2011 & December 21, 2011\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}

Then, we created each season and their corresponding range of dates before extracting the dates from the invoice dates. Using these dates, we categorized our data into seasons. From this, we separated the individual products and their corresponding quantities sold. Then, we made sure to compare only items that net at least one sale in every season throughout the year. We found that there were 1933 products that satisfied this criteria. It was a bit much to analyze all of these products individually, so instead we opted to find the top 3 products sold per season over the entire year. We ended up with the following 8 products:
```{r}
items.seasons
```

Then we plotted the quantities sold for each of these products over the year from which this data was gathered. It is important to note that we do not have full data for some seasons! Fall 2010 only has 3 weeks worth of data and Fall 2011 is missing 11 days of data. However, we can still see some general trends in popularity of products throughout the seasons. We look into this closer in the next section where we separate the data by month instead of season.

```

Since seasons cover a lot of days, we may have lost some details in trends of products. To remedy this we divided the data by months. We began by extracting the month and year from the invoice dates and used those as factors by which we split the data. Now that we had our data split by month, we separated the individual products and their corresponding quantities. Then, we made sure to compare only items that net at least one sale in every month throughout the year. We found that there were 1116 products that satisfied this criteria. It was a bit much to analyze all of these products individually, so instead we opted to find the top 3 products sold per month over the entire year. We ended up with the following 15 products:
```{r}
items
```

Then we plotted the quantities sold for each of these products over the year from which this data was gathered. Again, it is important to note that we do not have full data for December 2011! Specifically, we only had 9 days worth of data from this month. However, this still gives us a complete year's coverage from December 2010 to November 2011.

```{r, out.extra = 'angle = 270', fig.height = 11, fig.width = 11}
par(mfrow = c(4, 4), mar = c(6, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)
PlotQuantities <- function(d){
  for (i in 1:ncol(d)) {
    barplot(d[, i], col = rainbow(length(rownames(d))), names.arg = rownames(d), las = 2,
            main = items[i])
  }
}
PlotQuantities(d)
# All of these items were at one point the 3 most popular items in a month
# Note we do not have full data for December 2011!!! Only 9 days worth of data.

# Reset plotting parameters

### Which products are the most profitable for this company? What about least profitable?

We defined profit of a product by (net) quantity sold $\times$ unit price.

# Which products are the most profitable for this company? What about least profitable?

# Split the data frame by products

online.retail.products <- split(online.retail, StockCode)

# Total sales from each item. Note that some of them are adjusting bad debt and
# Amazon fees, bank charges, discounts, etc.
total.profit <- sapply(1:length(online.retail.products), function(i){
  total.profit <- sum(online.retail.products[[i]]$Quantity * online.retail.products[[i]]$UnitPrice)
  return (total.profit)
})

# Which products made more than $50,000
max.profit.ind <- which(total.profit > 50000)

max.profit.items <- sapply(1:length(max.profit.ind), function(i){
  # Get the product descriptions
  products <- sapply(online.retail.products[max.profit.ind], '[', 3)[[i]][1]
  # Return only one of them
  return (products)
})
# Corresponding item and profit
max.profit.items.df <- data.frame(Item = max.profit.items,
                                  Profit = total.profit[max.profit.ind])
```

Items that made more than $50,000 in profit were:
```{r}
max.profit.items.df
```

```{r}
# Which profits made less than $1 (but more than $0)?...
min.profit.ind <- which(total.profit < 1 & total.profit > 0)

min.profit.ind[which(min.profit.items == "")] <- NA
min.profit.ind <- min.profit.ind[!is.na(min.profit.ind)]

min.profit.items.df <- data.frame(Item = min.profit.items,
                                  Profit = total.profit[min.profit.ind])
```

Items that made less than $1, but did not lose the company money were:
```{r}
min.profit.items.df
```

Note that there were `r length(which(total.profit < 10 & total.profit > 0))` items that made less than $10, but it would be wasteful to print all `r length(which(total.profit < 10 & total.profit > 0))` of them, so we went with a smaller threshold of $1.

```{r}
# Which profits made no money ($0)?
zero.profit.ind <- which(total.profit == 0)

zero.profit.items <- sapply(1:length(zero.profit.ind), function(i){
  # Get the product descriptions
  products <- sapply(online.retail.products[zero.profit.ind], '[', 3)[[i]][1]
  # Return only one of them
  return (products)
})
zero.profit.items[which(zero.profit.items == "")] <- NA 
zero.profit.items <- zero.profit.items[!is.na(zero.profit.items)]
zero.profit.items <- unique(zero.profit.items)
zero.profit.items <- str_extract(zero.profit.items, "[A-Z]{2,}[A-Z\\,\\s\\-]+")
zero.profit.items <- zero.profit.items[!is.na(zero.profit.items)]
# Corresponding item and profit
zero.profit.items.df <- data.frame(Item = zero.profit.items,
                                   Profit = 0)
```

Items that made no money ($0) were:
```{r}
zero.profit.items.df
```

```{r}
# Which item generated the most profit/sales/income (that is not postage)?
best.profit.ind <- which(total.profit == 164762.19)

  # Get the product descriptions
  products <- sapply(online.retail.products[best.profit.ind], '[', 3)[[i]][1]
  # Return only one of them
  return (products)
})
```

The most profitable item (that was not postage) was `r best.profit.item` making the company $164,762.19.

# Putting everything together into a data frame
items.sold.countries <- data.frame(quantity = unlist(top.quantities.sorted.countries),

                                   avg.price = items.price)
rownames(items.sold.countries) <- names(quantities.sorted.countries)
```

We split our data by country before looking at individual products and their quantities sold. We also found the average unit price for the most popular products within each country. In the end we found:
```{r, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(items.sold.countries), comment = FALSE)
```


```{r}
# Finding the duplicate items so we can compare them between countries
duplicate.items <- unique(items.sold.countries[duplicated(items.sold.countries$item), ]$item)

items.sold.countries.dup <- lapply(1:length(duplicate.items), function(i){
  a <- subset(items.sold.countries, item == duplicate.items[i])
  return (a)
})
names(items.sold.countries.dup) <- duplicate.items
# As it turns out, there is no difference in price between countries
```

We noticed that we had some duplicate items in our data frame. That is, some items were popular in more than one country. We checked the average prices of these items between countries and found that there was no difference in price between countries.

This was surprising at first, but then we remembered that prices are in British pounds and that online postage accounted for $206,245.48 of this company's profit. So, of course unit price per product would be consistent because the company would charge more for postage depending on country. We then proceeded to visualize this information by plotting the quantity and average price of the most popular product bought by country.

```{r, warning = FALSE, out.extra = 'angle = 270', out.width = "612.5px", out.height = "840px"}
# Plotting all of this information

#Using GGPLOT, plot the Base World Map

#country.locations[which(country.names == "Brazil"), ] <- geocode("Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil")
#country.locations[which(country.names == "RSA"), ] <- geocode("South Africa")

# Quantity = size
# avg price = color

items.sold.countries.plot <- items.sold.countries[-c(33, 36), ]
mp + geom_point(data = items.sold.countries.plot, aes(x = country.locations$lon, y = country.locations$lat, col = avg.price, size = quantity))
```

# Conclusion and Discussion

In conclusion, we would offer the following advice to this online retailer. First, stock up on items before peak sales occur such as Christmas time for hand warmers. Second, get rid of low profit items and items that do not make any money. Third, recognize that business booms around the holiday season and they should plan accordingly. Also, they could try to do something special about countries' most popular products such as special deals to boost sales.

Although our analysis answered questions that we thought were initially interesting about this dataset, we quickly found that new questions emerged from our analysis. For example, we would have liked to analyze separate products individually such as the regency cakestands that brought in the most profit for this company. We could use time series to model its price and also compare it with different customers. In addition, we would have liked to find the most popular and profitable customers for this company and see if they could expand their business further by making deals with them.
