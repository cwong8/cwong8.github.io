<p>Hi there! My name is Christopher Wong and I graduated from UC Davis in 2017 with a double major in Mathematical and Scientific Computation (BS) and General Statistics (BS). After graduating, I spent a few months studying for the GRE and applying to graduate school. I wanted to pursue a Masters in mathematics and teach afterwards, but discovered that I missed programming and data analysis.</p>

<p>My interests include data analysis and optimization. In my spare time, I enjoy gaming, learning the piano, and browsing Reddit.</p>
