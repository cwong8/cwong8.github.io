Just someone who enjoys data, programming, and gaming. Mostly using SQL, Python, and R. Check out my projects!

Things I am working on:
- Warframe.market
    - Using the public API of warframe.market to scrape and store in a SQL database. Disappointed that past orders are not available on the API.
    - Maybe some visualization in Tableau.

- BDO Optimization
    - Reviewing optimization part. Might have to re-organize bdodae SQL database with a different schema.
    - Check simple algorithm using Dijkstra's algorithm against recursive ant colony optimization.
    
- Learning Javascript
    - Mostly for building dynamic webpages to show off interactive projects such as BDO Optimization.
